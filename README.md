## The PCB

The PCB including the ESP32-C3 Antenna has a total footprint of `20mmx30mm`. The files can be found in [`./pcb`](./pcb).

## The Code

The code currently is only a small placeholder to test the different parts of the PCB. The files can be found in [`./code`](./code) in form of a PlatformIO project.
